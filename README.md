# 📈 Option Pricing with Binomial Trees & Black–Scholes

**Language:** Python  
**Domain:** Quantitative Finance / Data Science  
**Platform:** Google Colab  
**Data Sources:** yfinance + FRED  
**Status:** In active development (research + experiments)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a **fully reproducible option pricing pipeline** that connects:

- Financial theory  
- Real market data  
- Numerical methods  
- Statistical analysis  

The goal is to price **European call options** using the **Cox–Ross–Rubinstein (CRR) binomial tree model** and validate the results against the **Black–Scholes closed-form solution**.

The project treats option pricing as a **data science workflow**, combining:

- Data acquisition  
- Parameter estimation  
- Numerical simulation  
- Model validation  

This creates a complete bridge between **finance, mathematics, and computation**.

---

## 🎯 Core Goals

This project investigates:

- How accurately the binomial model approximates Black–Scholes
- How binomial step count affects pricing error
- How volatility estimation impacts pricing
- The tradeoff between **accuracy vs computational cost**

---

## 📊 Key Features

- Real market data integration (stocks + interest rates)
- Binomial tree implementation from scratch
- Black–Scholes analytical pricing implementation
- Convergence analysis and error measurement
- Runtime and scalability analysis
- Fully reproducible notebook pipeline
- Visualization of pricing behavior and model convergence

---

## 🧠 Technical Implementation

### Financial Models Implemented

#### Cox–Ross–Rubinstein (CRR) Binomial Model
- Discrete-time stock price lattice
- Risk-neutral valuation
- Backward induction pricing
- Configurable number of steps (N)

#### Black–Scholes Model
- Closed-form European call pricing
- Used as the **benchmark / ground truth**

---

### Data Pipeline

The project uses **live financial data**:

- Stock prices → `yfinance`
- Risk-free rates → FRED
- Volatility estimated via:
  - Historical log returns
  - Implied volatility (optional)

---

## 🔬 Experiments & Analysis

### 1️⃣ Convergence Study
Compare binomial prices vs Black-Scholes by sweeping across step sizes:
N = {5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500}

Goal:
- Demonstrate numerical convergence
- Measure pricing error vs N

---

### 2️⃣ Volatility Sensitivity
Compare pricing using:

- Historical volatility
- Implied volatility

Shows how **parameter estimation affects pricing accuracy**.

---

### 3️⃣ Computational Efficiency
Measure runtime as tree depth increases.

Illustrates the tradeoff between:

- Computational cost  
- Pricing accuracy

## 📈 Example Results

Example using Starbucks (SBUX):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Binomial Price | 6.2614 |
| Black-Scholes Price | 6.3382 |
| Relative Error | **1.21%** |

Even with a small number of steps, the binomial model closely matches the continuous solution.
